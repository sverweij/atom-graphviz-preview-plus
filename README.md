## Features

- **live rendering** of your diagram
- **SVG export** - to file or clipboard
- **PNG export** - to file
- **Switch** the GraphViz **layout engine**. GraphViz Preview+ will
  remember the last one you used.
- For syntax highlighting we recommend
  [language-dot](https://github.com/AdoPi/language-dot) (the only one in
  `apm` at the moment). If it's not installed, GraphViz preview+ will take
  care of the installation.
- Uses **[viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js)** package for parsing and
  rendering, so no need to have graphviz installed.
- _Can_ use the original graphviz command line version if you want it to;
  tick the _use GraphViz command line_ option in the settings

## Why another GraphViz previewer?

Because I needed one.

There is an [other](https://atom.io/packages/graphviz-preview)
atom package for GraphViz. It is in dire need of
maintenance (e.g. it [doesn't](https://github.com/jumpkick/graphviz-preview/issues/32)
[work](https://github.com/jumpkick/graphviz-preview/pull/33)
[very well](https://github.com/jumpkick/graphviz-preview/issues/28)
in Atom versions > 1.0.0), but seems to be abandoned - last activity
is from May 2016.

GraphViz preview+ takes a more 'Atom-native' approach to integrating GraphViz.
This should make your GraphViz editing experience in Atom more pleasant.
Live rendering and svg export work out of the box; engine switching,
exporting to other formats and a lot of potential future features are easy
to implement, usually with just a few lines of code.
