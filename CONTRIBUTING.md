## Contributing

So you want to contribute to GraphViz previewer plus? W00t!

To make this as easy as possible for you, here's some simple guidelines:

### Reporting issues
- All **issues** are **welcome**.    
  - These include bug reports, questions, feature requests and enhancement
    proposals
  - [GitHub's issue tracker](https://github.com/sverweij/atom-graphviz-preview-plus/issues)
    is the easiest way to submit them.
- We prefer bug reports in  **_steps taken_ - _expected_ - _found_** format.
  - That makes it more easy to reproduce it, and concoct a solution that fits
     your expectation.
  - If applicable, it is also nice when you provide
    - the **input** you used and
    - the **environment** (browser version/ os, or node.js version + os).
  - [template](#issue-template) at the bottom
- In turn, we try to **respond within a week**.    
  This might or might not include an actual code fix.

### Contributing code
- We prefer well documented
  **[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)**
  based on the most recent version of the **master** branch.
- Code quality
    - Unit tests prove your code does what it intends.
    - Your code does not introduce regressions - ```apm test``` proves this.
    - Code style fits in with the current code base:
    - Additions pass coffeelint.
- Plan to do something drastic?     
  Contact @SanderSpeaks on Twitter, or leave an [issue](https://github.com/sverweij/atom-graphviz-preview-plus/issues/new) on GitHub

### Legal
- the code you add will be subject to
  [GPLv3](LICENSE.md), just like the rest of
